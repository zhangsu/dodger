/*
 * Interfaces for manipulating streams used by streaming sources. Streams are
 * usually necessary when the audio data is too massive to fit into main
 * memory as a whole (such as a background music, which can eat up to dozens of
 * megabytes of memory after decoding), in which case buffers are not suitable.
 *
 * Streams often contain multi-channel audio (since most of the time they are
 * used to play background music, and background music files are often
 * multi-channel already), which means that they often contain sound that are
 * not positioned, i.e., not processed by the 3D sound rendering pipeline. That
 * fact is totally fine for background music since they are usually not
 * associated to any object in the application. If positioned streams are
 * needed and the audio file has multi-channel, the audio file need to be
 * converted to mono-channel.
